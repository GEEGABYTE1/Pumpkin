# Pumpkin ðŸŽƒ

A Democratic DAO concept created to reflect Vitalik's vision of a real DAO.

# Commands
There are a few root commands to illustrate the power of the Pumpkin DAO.

`/global_chat` : Join and communicate with DAO users

`/init_vote`: Vote or create a vote proposal for the DAO

`/buy`: Buy a Cosemetic. 

# Voting

Users can vote, and create a vote as well. It should be noted that there is a `1/n` chance that their vote will be visible to a certain user. The random protocol is emplaced to make sure everyone has a fair chance for their vote to be seen. 

Each vote gets updated every 24 hours.

In terms of voting for proposals, users can vote upto 3 vote proposals. After that, they are restricted until the next day. This is to avoid corruption or any sort of biasness towards a vote genre if there maybe.

All vote proposals are added to a layer 1 blockchain called `Pumpkin`

# Buying

Users can buy program cosmetics, which are colours of their usernames (which is prompted at the start) on global chat. 

Everytime a user may run a command, the price of each colour changes ranging from 200 to 631 seeds (in-built currency). 

Colours include: *grey, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white*

Any user when initially logged in will start off with 100 seeds initially, and get somewhere from 1 - 150 each command they run depending on the randomness of the algorithm.

The buying process is ran on a layer-2 network (one for the colour and the rates and the second one to keep track of transactions).
