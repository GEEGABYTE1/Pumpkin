# Pumpkin ðŸŽƒ

A Democratic DAO concept created to reflect Vitalik's vision of a real DAO.

# Commands
There are a few root commands to illustrate the power of the Pumpkin DAO.

`/global_chat` : Join and communicate with DAO users

`/init_vote`: Vote or create a vote proposal for the DAO

`/buy`: Buy a Cosemetic. 

# Voting

Users can vote, and create a vote as well. It should be noted that there is a `1/n` chance that their vote will be visible to a certain user. The random protocol is emplaced to make sure everyone has a fair chance for their vote to be seen. 

Each vote gets updated every 24 hours.

In terms of voting for proposals, users can vote upto 3 vote proposals. After that, they are restricted until the next day. This is to avoid corruption or any sort of biasness towards a vote genre if there maybe.

All vote proposals are added to a layer 1 blockchain called `Pumpkin`
